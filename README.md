### Hi there 👋

**Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile, it's great to meet you here!** 😊

Here are some quick things about me:

- 🔭 I'm a pragmatic software engineer who is paranoid about convention, consistency, and constraints.
- 🕵️‍♀️ I used to mainly use C++ and C# for high concurrency program development, and now I am very interested in HPC and oneAPI.
- 🧸 I'm proud of who I am, what I have built, and what I am building.
- 🧑‍💻 Coding is my passion.
- 💬 I like reading and imagining things when I'm not busy.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is to send me an [email](mailto:Perry961002@163.com).
